My scripts and configs for Archlinux

## Dotfiles
Feel free to use or take as an inspiration as you see fit.
Keep in mind that these are only intended for my personal use, so don't expect thorough testing for every usecase!

## (ArchLinux) Install scripts
Never use random install scripts that you don't fully understand!
If in doubt, adhere to the [official installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)
These scripts are purely for my personal usecase and not meant to be universal. Feel free to adapt them to your needs though.
